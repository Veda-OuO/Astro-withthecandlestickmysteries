    <p>At the far end of the kitchen, Mrs. Lawrence was working at the sink. Her back was to me when I entered the long, tiled room.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Without her notice, I crept between the rows of stainless steel work stations, scanning the countertops for remnants of this evening&rsquo;s dinner preparations. Every surface had been wiped clean; every dish had been washed and stowed in its proper place. Her kitchen was spotless.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Tipping my head below the appliances, I found nothing but a thin layer of dust&ndash; and even less in the way of evidence.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the fridge: fresh bread, raw vegetables, and a big bowl of chili stew. Just in case, I secured the contents for further testing.</p>
