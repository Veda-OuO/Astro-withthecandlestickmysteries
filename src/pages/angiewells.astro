  <div class="text-box">
    <p>The woman in the yellow jacket was identified as Angie Wells– wife of Fred Wells, owner of the Salem Casino– and an avid bird watcher.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>After their failed attempts to resuscitate, the EMTs had pronounced her dead on scene.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>She was still lying in the hall, her body untouched, when I knelt next to her for a more thorough examination. Searching the pockets of her jacket I found a small bag of pills, a handful of used tissues, and a slender, brass key <strong>(Pr-1)</strong>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Her cheeks were pale and cold, like her fingers. I held them in my hand, examining them for signs of a struggle. She had a spiral platinum band on her left pinky, a gold ring on the index finger of her right, but no wedding ring.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In my discussions with the EMTs, the leading theory was poison.</p>
